description: A very basic introduction to promises in Java-script

# Promises kept and broken

The concept of promises in Java-script hinges on the literal meaning of the word _promise._ We either keep a promise we made or we break it. Translated to the java-script, when we _keep_ a promise, we _resolve_ it and when we _break_ our promise we _reject_ it.

When it comes to the word promise, in our daily activity, we are basically making a statement based on certain conditions, the outcomes of which we are unaware of or outside our control. For example, "_I will return the book to you as soon as I get back_". The statement is _"I will return the book to you"_, the condition part being _"as soon as I get back_". Here the condition part is uncertain, in the sense that I will get back and return the book or I will not get back and so the book will not be returned.
